      <h2 id="section-1">3D Printing</h2>
      <p>3D Printing, the art of turning almost nothing into kinda something. With a cheap, off-brand 3D printer I can create almost anything you can imagine. If you imagine something that already exists a 3D printer can make it for cheaper and at a lower quality. True masters of this manufacturing process can create stunning pieces of art and creative tools for life's many minor inconveniences.</p>
      <p>I, however, am not a master of 3D printing and most of my printer's working hours have been spent running a multitude of benchmark tests trying to reach some state of calibration. 3D printing is a newer hobby for me but I am excited for its application once I figure out what I am doing.</p>

      <h2 id="section-2" style="text-align: right;">Miniature Painting</h2>
      <p>In my 25ish rotations around our sun, I have always tried to be creative. I took every art class all the way through highschool before I realized that I was kinda bad with most mediums. Miniature painting has been my exception and my go to for creative expression. I enjoy spending my weekend afternoons with a nice 32mm miniature and some acrylic paint.</p>

      <div>
         <p>Now this is the main event. I enjoy creating, but to see my creations come to life through a good set of rules gets my nerd blood pumping. After countless hours of semi-skilled labor it is all worth it for the thrills of tabletop gaming. Always one bad dice role away from both monumental failure & triumphant success. Whether you game to inflict the sting of defeat upon your friends or boost your group's comradery, every night at the table is a night well spent.</p>
